# webrtc test

This project was implemented over the course of a weekend hackathon in Chattanooga, TN (Hackanooga!).
It uses WebRTC to connect 2-6 people together using WebRTC.

Though the project could likely handle more users, it was not tested or refined for such use.
It was just a hack! With all the changes made to WebRTC since this project was created (Sept 2012),
this code may be completely unusable now.

Scary code may likely lie within these repo walls, enter at risk.
