# webrtc test

This project was implemented over the course of a weekend hackathon in Chattanooga, TN.
It at that current time used Web-RTC to connect 2-6 people together using Web-RTC.

Though the project could likely handle more, it was not tested or refined for such use.
It was just a hack! With all the changes made to WebRTC since this project was created,
this code may be completely unusable.

Scary code may likely lie within these repo walls, enter at risk.
